# Load packages and data

To get started, **load in the needed packages**: {tidyverse}, {here}, and {esquisse}.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, here, esquisse)
```

Now, let's **read the dataset into your RStudio environment**. The data frame you import should have 142 rows and 9 columns. Remember to use the `here()` function to use project-relative paths.

```{r}
pa_raw <- read_csv(here("data/obesity.csv"))
```

Next, remove the first two variables of the data frame, as they are not relevant to our analysis today.

```{r}
pa_mini <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

Now, view the new dataset and compare it to the variable definitions below.

```{r}
head(pa_mini)
```

Your data should have 7 variables now:

-   `status`: adult (Adulte) or child (Enfant)
-   `bmi`: body mass index
-   `sedentary_ap_s_day`: sedentary behaviour (seconds/week)
-   `light_ap_s_day`: light physical activity (seconds/week)
-   `mvpa_s_day`: moderate to vigorous physical activity (seconds/week)
-   `oms_recommendation`: whether or not WHO recommendations for physical activity are being met (OMS stands for Organisation mondiale de la SantÃ©, which is the French name for WHO)

# Clean data with {dplyr}

## **Step 1**: Examine and clean dataset (Instructor demo)

Before jumping into wrangling or plotting, let's think about the types of variables in our dataset. Take note of which variables should be numeric and which should be factors.

Now let's check that R has classified these variables correctly. You can check the data classes assigned to each variable with `summary()` or `glimpse()`.

```{r}
summary(pa_mini)
```

Notice that some of your variables are of class **character**, but they should be **numeric** (e.g. `bmi`). This is because those variables have some words in them in addition to numbers. Can you spot those words when you view the dataset?

Other variables of class character should be **factors**.

We need to change these variables to correct type, because this will be essential for further manipulations and for plotting!

We can use `mutate()` to convert your variables into the right type.

**Hint**: There are 3 variables that should be factors, and 4 that should numeric.

```{r}
pa_clean <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

**Note**: You may get a warning message about your numeric columns. This is telling you that some NAs were introduced to the data. This is not a problem in this case, so you can disregard the message.

Now that you have converted them, use `summary()` or `glimpse()` again to check that the data classes are correct. Notice that in your new numeric columns, the text that used to be there as been replaced with `NA` (this is what the warning message was about).

## **Step 2**: Convert the physical activity variables

Currently, the variables of physical activity are in seconds per day. There are 3 types of physical activity variables: sedentary behavior (`sedentary_ap_s_day`), light physical activity (`light_ap_s_day`), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (`mvpa_s_day`). These variables are measured in seconds per day.

However, the [WHO recommendations](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf) for physical activity are in minutes per week, so we want to align with these measures. To do this, complete the following manipulations:

1.  Convert these numerical variables from **seconds/day** to **minutes/week**. (Hint: use `mutate()` to create new variables that are in minutes per week. As a kind reminder, 60 seconds = 1 minute and 7 days = 1 week.)

2.  Remove the previous seconds per day variables. (Hint: you can use `ends_with()` within the `select()` function.)

```{r}
pa_clean1 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

Lastly, rename `oms_recommendation` to `who_recommendation` (OMS is French for WHO).

```{r}
pa_clean2 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

## **Step 3**: Combine physical activity variables

Create a new column that adds light physical activity with moderate to vigorous physical activity. This should give us the total amount of activity in minutes per week.

```{r}
pa_clean3 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

## **Step 4**: Replace values in selected columns

The `sex` variable uses the letter "M" for male and "F" for female. Replace values in that column to say "Male" and "Female" instead of "M" and "F".

```{r}
pa_clean4 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

Now, transform the `status` variable, to change "Aldulte" to "Adult" and "Enfant" to "Child".

```{r}
pa_clean5 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

# Visualize data with {esquisse}

## **Plot 1**: Histogram

Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single numeric (continuous) variable. Chose a variable from the dataset that you can plot a histogram with.

Using esquisse, create your histogram.

```{r}
"ESQUISSE_CODE_HERE"
```

Note: Sometimes code generated by esquisse can have unwanted filtering. This is due to a bug in the package. Double check your code and remove any extra `filter()` operations.

## **Plot 2**: Boxplot

Boxplots are used to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable, split by the values of a discrete variable.

1.  Use esquisse to create a boxplot to show the distribution of a numeric variable (the same one used for your histogram) and plot it against a categorical variable from the dataset.

2.  Set fill color to match the values of your categorical variable.

```{r}
"PASTE_THE_ESQUISSE_CODE_HERE"
```

# Wrap up

That's it for this assignment! We will choose 2-3 people to present your work during the workshop. If you would like to share your results with the class, please let an instructor know.
