This document is a model example of what a report for this assignment can look like. You may use this document as a guide for how to write your report.

Note that:

-   The example uses the motorcycle accidents dataset from Colombia, but you should use the **India TB dataset**.
-   **Code echo is turned off** in all code chunks so that the finished product hides the source code, showing only the output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r include = F}
# Load packages
# if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, here, patchwork, janitor, esquisse, flextable)
```

## Road Injuries of Motorcyclists in Medellín

The dataset analysed in this report provides information about deaths caused by motorcycle accidents in Medellín, a Colombian city. The data is sourced from medical and police certificates and can he access [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4836304).

```{r echo = F, message = F}
# Data import
col_accidents <- read_csv(here("data/teachers_example_data_motorcycle_accidents_colombia.csv"))
```


```{r echo = F, message = F}
# Data cleaning
# the age group column name (and a few others) have spaces in them. This makes them hard to work with.
# To remove these from the column names, we can use the clean_names function from janitor
col_accidents_clean <- clean_names(col_accidents)
```

## Age group distribution per sex group

The two categorical variables I chose to look at are age group and sex.

The plot below shows the age group distributions for each sex:

```{r echo = F, fig.width=11}
# esquisse::esquisser(col_accidents)

# Plot for male victims.
male <-
  col_accidents_clean %>%
  filter(gender %in% "male") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = age_group) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#678BCB") +
  labs(title = "Age group distribution of fatalities from motorcycle accidents",
       subtitle = "(Men)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15L, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15L))
  
# Plot for female victims
female <-
  col_accidents_clean %>%
  filter(gender %in% "female") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = age_group) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#A4BBB6") +
  labs(subtitle = "(Women)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15L,face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15L))

# combine plots with `+` or `/` function from the patchwork package. 
# see teacher commentary below
# or see https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/ for details on using patchwork

male + female
```

And the table below shows similar information:

```{r include = F}
# Create a summary data frame of two categorical variables with janitor::tabyl()
freq_df <- tabyl(col_accidents_clean, age_group, gender)
freq_df

# NOTE THAT THE CHUNK OPTIONS HERE SAY "include = F". This ensures that the data frame is not printed in the knitted HTML.
```

For both sexes, the age group with the most deaths was the 20 to 24 age group. In women, there were `r freq_df[2,2]` deaths in this age group, and in men there were `r freq_df[2,3]` deaths.

```{r echo = F}
# Print your frequency table in a pretty format
flex <- flextable(freq_df)

flex_with_caption <- set_caption(flex, caption = "Age & gender distribution of fatalities from motorcycle accidents")
flex_with_caption
```

## Areas of improvement

-   The two bar charts have different numbers of bars. This is not ideal for comparisons.
-   The age group labels are too horizontally compressed.
-   I do not yet know how to change the variable names, so I left in the name `age_group` in the table and plot.
